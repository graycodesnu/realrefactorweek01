# realrefactorweek01

## Introduction

This project is a result of our boot camp's week 1 homework assignment. Students were given starter HTML and CSS code, which we needed to modify in order to meet several requirements outlined in the next section. 

## Goals

The client's goal was to optimize their website for search engines by refactoring existing code to:

+ Meet accessibility standards
+ Use semantic vs. non-semeantic elements 
+ Ensure the logical sequential nesting of elements throughout 
+ Create a descriptive title element 
+ Incorporate assets 

## Results 

+ Replaced non-semantic elements (mostly div tags) with semantic elements (such as body, header, section tags)
+ Added header, footer, and title elements 
+ Added alt attributes and titles for each asset to ensure screen reader compatibility 
+ Edited CSS code to be compatible with new semantic HTML elements
